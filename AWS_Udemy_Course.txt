-----------------------------------
IAM - Identity and Access Management
------------------------------------
When account created it will be root user(perfer not to use - as it has high permissions)
Users or Groups - assigned JSON document - Policies - Permission - least privilege principle
- Groups only contains users not groups 
- users in each group will have same privilages
- tags are added for description
IAM Policy Structure - JSON document
- Version and ID
- contains statements
	- sid - statement Id - Optional
	- effect - Allow/Deny
	- Principal - account/user/role - Optional
	- Action - list of actions to allow/deny - get/put - can be *
	- Resource - list of resource on which action can be preformed - can be *
	- Conditional - optional
IAM Password Policy
IAM MFA - Multi Factor Authentication = Password + Security Device(Virtual MFA Device, U2F - Universal 2nd Factor - chip, Hardware Key Fob MFA Device, AWS GovCloud(US)) - to setup select the profile and My Security Credentials

User Access AWS - Protection
- AWS Management Console - password + MFA
- AWS Command Line Console(CLI) - Access Key required to configure(from CLI software), Cloudshell(not available in all regions)
- AWS Software Development Kit(SDK) - Language Specific - Access Key 
	- IAM Roles - for communicating with the applications.
IAM Security Tools

EBS Volume - Elastic Block Store - Network Drive - Zone Restricted
- used to persist date even after the instance is terminated
- Bound to a Zone(if snapshot is taken, we can move along)
- can be mounted to only one instance at a time
- by default, root EBS Volume will be deleted when root EC2 Instance is terminated.(can be controlled to preserve root volume when instance is terminated)
- by default, any other EBS volume is not deleted 
- EBS Snapshot - to restore or to transfer it to a different zone
	- copy a snapshot to  different Zone or region
	- create a new volume with the snapshot to a different zone
EBS Volumes - 6 Types
- gp2/gp3 - General purpose SSD - used for boot volume, Dev/test env
	- Cost Effective Storage, low latency, 1GB to 16TB, 16000 IOPS
	- gp2 - IOPS and throughput are linked
	- gp3 - IOPS and throughput are independent
- io1/io2 - Highest Performance SSD - used for boot volume
	- Provisioned IOPS - critial applicaitons, 4GB to 16TB, 32,000 OPS
	- increase PIOPS independent of storage

EBS Multi-Attach - io1/io2 family
- one EBS can be attached to multiple EC2 Instance in the same Zone
- High application availability in clusters - Tera Data
- Manage concurrent write operations

AMI - Amazon Machine Image - Zone Restricted
- Contains bootstrap to start an Instance
- can be customized - add your OS, Software, Config
- Public AMI/ Own AMI/ AWS Marketplace AMI
- can be copies to difference zones but are not for other regions
- Process - create an instance -> create an Image -> use the created Image to create another instance.

EC2 Instance Store - Ephemeral Drive
- high performance hardware disk - IO operations
- attaching the physical hardware disk to EC2 Instance
- Lose their storage if EC2 Instance is terminated

EFS - Elastic File System
- Managed NFS, Mountable across Zones(distinct from EBS - only one zone)
- Highly available, scalable(PB size), expensive, Pay as per use
- Web applications
- Uses Security group for control access
- only Linux based AMI supported - POSIX 
- Performance Mode - Types
	- General purpose - latency sensitive application(Web server)
	- Max IO - higher latency, throughput, highly parallel(bigdata)

	- Provisioned - throughput independent of storage
- Storage Tiers - Life cylce management feature - Storage class
	- Standard - frequently used
	- Infrequent access(EFS-IA) - cost for retrival, low storage
-Process - create EFS, create instances in different zones, SSH to instance - install amazon-efs-utils, format security group for inbound/outbound, attach the EFS to instances,

ELB - Elastic Load Balancer - Managed Load Balancer
- spread load to multiple downstream instances
- Single point DNS for application
- Health check up - port 4567 endpoint: /health - 200 response 
- Provides SSL connectivity
- high availability across Zone
- Security Groups 
	- Inbound - all http/https
	- Outbound - security group of EC2 Instance
- For the EC2 Instances Security Group - Inbound - only from the ELB
4 ELB Types (Client -> ELB -> EC2 Instance)
- Classic Load Balancer - old - not used 
	- Supports TCSp(Layer 4) and HTTP/HTTPS(Layer 7) 
	- Fixed Host - xxx.region.elb.amazonaws.com
- Application Load Balancer(ALB)
	- HTTP(Layer 7) 
	- Multiple HTTP Application(Target Group - multiple Instances) 
	- HTTP to HTTPS, WebSocket 
	- Routing 
		- Path - example.com/user or example.com/posts
		- host name - one.example.com or two.example.com
		- Query String - example.com/user?id=1234
	- Microservice or Container based applications
	- Health Check happens at the target group level
	- Target Group
		- Multiple EC2 Instances
		- ECS tasks
		- Lambda Functions
		- Private IP address
	- Fixed Host - xxx.region.elb.amazonaws.com
	- Clients IP not know to the EC2 Instances but to get it X-Forwarded-For needs to be added to the header
- Network Load Balancer(NLB) 
	- Traffic flows from the Client to the EC2 Instance
	- TCP and UDP Traffic
	- less latency(100ms) vs 400ms for ALB
	- one static Fixed IP ( Elastic IP Address) per Zone - can be Whitelisting specific IP
	- Exterme Performance
	- Target Groups
		- EC2 Instance
		- IP Address 
		- Application Load balancer
- Gateway Load Balancer(GWLB)
	- Layer 3
	- functions
		- Transparent Network Gateway - single entry/exit
		- Load Balancer - distribute traffic to applications
	- Deploy, Scale and Manage 3rd party network virtual applications in AWS
	- All traffic goes through gateway and then to the target group containing EC2 instances and then passes through the gateway to the application
	- client -> GWLB -> Target Group -> GWLB -> Applications
	- GENEVE Protocal - port 6081
	- Target Groups
		- EC2 Instances
		- Private IP
Sticky Sessions - session affinity - 
	- client makes two request will go to the same EC2 Instance
	- Classic and Application Load Balancer
	- Reserved Cookie names - AWSALB, AWSALBAPP, AWSALBTG
	- Cookier used with expiration date 
		- Application Cookie
			- Custom Cookie
				- generated by target 
				- specific to target group
			- Application Cookie
				- generated by load balancer - AWSALBAPP
		- Duration-based cookie
			- generated by load balancer
			- AWSALB for ALB, AWSELB for CLB
	- creates imbalances 
	- Process - Target group - Edit Attributes - stickiness
Cross-Zone Load Balancer
	- Each load balancer instance distributed evenly across all instances in a zone
	- ALB - Always On - no inter zone data changes
	- NLB - Disabled (default) - inter zone data changes apply
	- CLB - Disabled (default) - no inter zone data changes
Ecryption in Loadbalancer
	SSL - Secure Sockets Layer - in-flight encryption 
	TLS - Transport Layer Security 
	ACM - AWS Certificate Manager (SSL/TLS)
	User -> https(encrypted) -> LoadBalancer -> http(VPC) -> EC2 Instance
	SNI - Server Name Indication
		- multiple SSL Certificate onto one web server
		- works with ALB and NLB.
Connection Draining
	- CLB - Connection Draining
	- ALB & NLB - Deregistration Delay
	- in-flight request are given time to complete while the instance in de-registered or unhealthy

Auto Scaling Group (ASG) - Free service
- Scale out - adding Instances
- Scale In  - removing Instances
- min, desired and max
- Automatically register new instance
- Possible to scale based on CloudWatch
- Metrics(used for alarms) are computed for overall ASG instances
- ASG will automatically create a new replacement instance if a instance is terminated(for any reason)- it will not restart
- Always needs a EC2 Instance Templace to scale IN/OUT
- scale-IN/Out Dynamically
- Cooldown Period - 300 seconds - will not launch or terminate additional instances
- use AMI for quicker faster instance creation
Types
- Target Tracking Scaling - CPU usage
- Simple/Step Scaling - need to set how many instances to add/remove based on cloudwatch
- Scheduled Actions - Anticipated scaling 
- Predictive Scaling -  Continuously forcast and scaling ahead
Metrics
- CPUUtilization - Average
- RequestCountPerTarget - ALB
- Average Network In/Out - NLB
- Any Custom Metrics -  using CloudWatch

	- Storage backed by EBS
	- NO SSH for instances
- RDS Auto Scaling - set Maximum Storage Threshold 
- RDS Read Replicas
	- Scalable Reads
	- 5 read replicas - in AZ, Cross AZ, Cross Region)
	- Replication is ASYNC(eventually consistent)
	- can be promoted to a main DB
	- need to update all the read replica's by the application
	- Network Cost
		- read replica 
			- same region - no fee
			- cross region - fee
- RDS Multiple AZ - Disaster Recover
	- SYNC replication - one DSN name - automatic failover
	- Not used for scaling
	- Standby is failover -> master fails Standby becomes master
	- Read replica be setup in multiple AZ for Disaster Recovery
- RDS - Single AZ to Multi AZ
	- Zero Downtown
	- modify the setting - no work to be done
	- Snapshot taken from master, restore to standby and SYNC setup
- RDS Security - Encryption
	- At Rest
		- Only happen at time of RDS creation (else use snapshot method to encrypt)
		- can encrypt master and read replica with AWS-KMS
		- Transparent Data Encryption(TDE) - Oracle and SQL Server 
		- If master is no encryption, read replica cannot be encrypted
	- In-flight encryption
		- SSL certificate to encrypt data
		- SSL option provided while RDS connection
	- RDS backup
		- Snapshot 
			- encrypted RDS <=> encrypted snapshot
			- unencrypted RDS <=> unencrypted snapshot
		- encrypt and un-encrypted RDS
			- create snapshot of unencrypted RDS
			- copy the snapshot and enable encryption for snapshot
			- Restore the db from encrypted snapshot
			- migrate applicatio to the new DB and delete old DB
	- RDS network & IAM
		- deployed private
		- security 
		- To enforce SSL 
			- MySQL - run query on users
			- PostGres - enable a flag
		- Access Management
			- IAM policy
			- username/pwd
			- IAM based authentication - MySQL and PostgreSQL
				- no password needs only token(lifetime 15 min) via RDS service
				- IAM to cental manage users than in the DB

Amazon Aurora:
- AWS properatory - not open source, AWS Cloud Optimized
- Postgres(3X), MySQL(5X) Driver available
- 15 read replica, Failover is instant(30 sec), one Master
- 20% more costlier than RDS
- Replication(6 at anytime across zones, Supports cross region replication) + Self healing + Auto Expanding(10Gb to 64TB)
- Backtrack - go to a point of time without backups
- Process
	client -> writer Endpoint -> one Master DB -> Shared storage volume -> read replica(auto scalling) -> Reader Endpoint(connection Load Balancing) -> Client

Amazon ElastiCache:
- Managed Redis or Memcached
- in-memory databases for high performance and low latency
- application stateless - required heavy code changes to configure
- Redis	- similar to RDS in properties
	- multiple AZ, failover, read replica scaling
	- backup and restore
	- Data durability using AOF persistance
- Memcached - prone to failure
	- multi-node for partitioned - sharding
	- no high availbility(replication)
	- No persistance, no backup, no restore
	- multi-threded architecture 
- Strategy
	- Lazy loading/cache-Aside/Lazy Population - read penality, Write quick
		- cache hit = application -> Amazon Elastic Cache
		- cache miss = application -> Amazon RDS -> Write to Cache - 3 network trip
		- probablity of stale data when cache hit
	- Write Through - add or update cache when DB is updated - write penality, read quick
		- cache hit = application -> Amazon Elastic Cache
		- application -> write -> Amazon RDS -> Write to Cache 
		- Cache chum -  lot of cache data written but never read
	- Cache Evictions
		- explicitly delete
		- Last recently used when cache is full
		- TTL - set time-to-live
- Replication	
	- Multiple AZ capability
	- upto 500 nodes per cluster
	- Cluster Mode Disabled
		- one primary node(Read/write) - 5 replicas(read) - ASYNC
		- all in one shard
	- Cluster Mode Enabled
		- data is partitioned across shards
		- each shard will have one primary node - 5 replica

	- Domain => IP Address
	- Need to register your domain - Domain registar
	- DNS records
	- Zone Files - contains DNS records
	- Name Server - resolved DNS queries - map domain to IP
	- Top Level Domain(TLD) - root - com, in, us, gov
	- Second Level Domain(SLD) - + TLD -  amazon.com, google.com
	- Sub domain - + SLD + TLD
	- Domain name - Sub Domain + SLD +TLD
	- Fully Qualified Domain Name - FQDN = Domain + subdomain + SLD + TLD
